# Implementation Roadmap

## v0.1A

Implement local service foundation, registries, safety policy, audit logs, project inspection, disabled connector placeholders, and tests.

## Later Versions

Future versions may add controlled execution, UI surfaces, and external connectors only after safety boundaries are expanded deliberately. Those features are not implemented in v0.1A.

## v0.1B Workflow Foundation

The first v0.1B slice adds task orchestration, event history, approval records, project locks, dry-run planning, action receipts, risk budget checks, diagnostics export, and report validation. It does not execute Codex or shell commands.

## Future v0.1B Slices

Future reviewed slices can add controlled execution only after the approval and receipt model is proven. Codex execution remains a non-goal for this foundation slice.

## v0.1B Codex Execution Planning

This slice adds Codex plan records, safe command previews, prompt planning, risk-budget validation, approval linkage, receipts, events, and diagnostics summaries. The approved status means approved for a future execution slice only.

## v0.1B Controlled Codex Execution

This slice adds one approved-plan execution path through the official local Codex CLI. It validates approval, command preview, project paths, prompt/output boundaries, run limits, and project locks before execution. Repair loops and generic shell execution remain future work.
